            <h1>Hapis Island is BACK!.. Again.</h1>
            <h2>(but for good this time!)</h2>
            <p>
                Hapis Island was a port of the legacy Rust map, including everything a survival player looks for in a good server.<br>
                The community was a vibrant conglomeration of multiple nationalities and players from every walk of life, in our 7 YEARS (Yes, that's right!)<br>
                playing Hapis Island us as a community know this map like the backs of our hands and have done our best to restore it to its previous glory.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have added some custom monuments to bring the map back up to speed with the rest of Rust as well as adding underground train tunnels.<br>
                Lots is planned for the future, and we won't lie to you, there are some bugs but we're working hard to squash them all so feel free to post any you find in the discord channel.
            </p>
            <p>
                [EU West] OBNXS Hapis is a wide open space for so many people to enjoy and server security is among our top priorities,<br> no one likes cheaters so please make sure to F7 Report any
                you come across on our server (or any for that matter).<br> It's best not to call this out in global chat as it encourages them to avoid doing it and getting caught by inspecting admins.
            </p>
            <p>
                One big problem with Facepunch official servers is there are so many of them for the small team to look after all at once, and without active admins to look into reports instantly<br> cheaters tend to get away 
                with their software for longer. Make sure to check discord to see if there are any staff positions you may be interested in.
            </p>
            <p> 
                We are a small team of three people from UK, US and Netherlands. We are all friends that have been playing Rust & especially Hapis Island since Mid 2016 together.<br>
                Feel free to ask any questions you want in the discord as we're friendly and happy to help even the newest of players get on their way to learning the ropes of Rust.
